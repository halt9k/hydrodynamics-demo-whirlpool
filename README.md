# Fluid dynamics realtime demo:

**Whirlpool formation in a hourglass**

This is bianry demo (without source code) sandbox for fluid dynamics.  
Based on heavily interfaced and updated sources https://github.com/wme7/openLBMflow.

Made with c++, DirectX, Qt UI, OpenMP optimizations

Source code has too raw quality to be published, however - if will be free (not guaranteed now due to political situation) and  
if will have time - there are plans to finish, polish and publish it. 
Sources are placed in my private repo and if this account became unresponsive for more than 6mon I give permision to public them.

Applying potential force to two phase fluid:
