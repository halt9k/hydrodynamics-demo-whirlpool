# Hydrodynamics realtime demo: whirlpool formation in a hourglass

This is bianry demo (without source code) sandbox for fluid dynamics.  
Based on heavily interfaced and updated sources https://github.com/wme7/openLBMflow.

Made with c++, DirectX, Qt UI, OpenMP optimizations

Source code has too raw quality to be published, however if will be alive (not guaranteed now due to political situation) and  
if will have time there are plans to finish, polish and publish it. 
Sources are placed in my private repo and if this account became unresponsive for more than 6mon I give permision to publish them.
